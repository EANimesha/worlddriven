      World driven introduces a contribution based weighted voting system
      for merging of pull requests. As soon as you contribute to a project, you get a share or
      responsibility for the progress of the project.
    </div>

      The rules:
      <ul>
        <li>A Pull Request gets automatic merged after some time. The default configuration
          is 10 days/commit.</li>
        <li>Contributors of the project can vote by reviewing the Pull Request. The votes
          are weighted by the number of commits on the repository. The according share is
          added or subtracted from the overall time. If it exceeds the time, so more votes
          against the merge, the merge is not executed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This way a review can speed up the merge process. Or can prolog or stop it
      to discuss further the concerns.
