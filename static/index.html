      World driven introduces a contribution based weighted voting system
      for merging of pull requests. As soon as you contribute to a project, you get a share or
      responsibility for the progress of the project.

    <div>
      <h2>How it works:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A Pull Request gets automatic merged after some time.</li>
        <li>Contributors of the project can vote by reviewing the Pull Request.</li>
        <li>Votes are weighted based on the number of commits on the repository. The according share is
          added or subtracted from the time to merge.</li>
        <li>If it exceeds the default time, more votes against the merge, the merge is not executed.</li>
      </ul>
      This way a review can speed up the merge process. Or can prolong or stop it
      to discuss the concerns.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>Why?:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to the clear rules it is easy to see what happens with your PR and
          when it will be merged.</li>
        <li>Some open source projects struggle with their maintainer. This way others
          can still drive the project forward.</li>
        <li>Weighting the votes enables the main contributors the most power to
          stale or block bad PRs or speed things up. On the other hand it can
          motivate to contribute to increase their own weight.</li>
        <li>One fundamental question is the ownership. Currently the owner of the
          project has anyway full control and can stop or speed up everything. It
          would be nice if they don't have to.
      </ul>
      <br />

      I'm pretty sure the system can be tricked with certain behavior, that's not the idea.
      Working on an open source project is collaborating, so most of the tricking
      can easily solved by communication.

      <h2>Current Rules:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>10 days, well more then a week, should give everyone enough time to look into</li>
        <li>per commit: If a PR has multiple commits the time is increased for each commit.
          Having multiple commits on a PR means the feature reaches a certain complexity,
          hence reviewers should have enough time to review it.</li>
        <li>Voting via review: Github reviewing functionality is the perfect place to
          discuss the PR and express the preference. (Gitlab the same, but not yet implemented)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vision</h2>

      Having clear and automated rules for progressing in open source projects
      is just the base.
      Due to the DevOps (or GitOps) idea many operational tasks are now stored
      in repositories, too, and applied on merge. So the challenge is building
      (worlddriven) services, which are only maintained via Pull Requests.

      This provides a new level of trust and a new entity <i>unavailable system
        data</i> (still searching for a better name).
      Passwords, service credentials, ... is data which does not necessarily be
      accesible by humans. This can be maintained and used only in the system.<br/>
      <br/>
      Example: In one of the company I was working for the employees were using
      chromeboxes. Within their daily work they had to split and merge PDFs.
      There are a lot of (free) services out there which just do the job, but
      they can't be used. What happens with my PDFs, do they store them, do they
      use them. I hope and guess not, but I'm not sure.<br/>
      <br/>
      How about a PDF service, open source, world driven, continous deployment.
      No one has access to any credentials, changes can only be done via public
      Pull Requests. That should be fine?
